## Self declared deliverables

Eagle AI being an AI proctoring systems provides proctoring using the audio and visual inputs from the exam candidate. The continuous proctoring analyses the candidates' attention to the exam-paper/teacher using audio analysis and eye tracking. The delivered system should be able to successfully detect if the candidate is cheating. And if found cheating the proctor or authorities should be informed via mail with all the necessary information. The provided system should be able to track the eyes to confirm if the cadidate is looking at anywhere else than the content provided along with the time elapsed. Also the system should be able to convert the audio to speech and also provide the confidence level of the text generated in order to confirm if there was any audio that was used unfairly.

## Project Components

### FrontEnd

The proposed solution's frontend was build with the help of Javascript and CSS web technologies. There are various html and css files that are integrated together to create a user friendly and simple but effective user interface. The user on visiting the home page of Eagle AI is given information about the solution and a link to login further. The user then visits the login page and after entering the credentials, the user can move to further selecting the different services that the solution offers. Either it be class or examination the user can select either option to further get into the proctoring mode.

### BackEnd

The system uses JavaScript for backend tasks to create an extremely responsive and effective solution for proctoring with the help of various frameworks. The various activities in the system run with the help of Javascript. Along with the github pages deployment, any user can visit the page from anywhere without any hassle. The backend forms a very strong foundation for any project and with the help of Javascript and Github pages, the backend works in a very efficient manner.

## TechStack Used

### Libraries

Various JS libraries were used in the implementation of the solution. One of the library used is WebGazer that helps in eye tracking on various browser that made the work of tracking eyes very easy and platform independent. Another library that we used was the Speech Recogonition API for javascript, that helped in converting the audio coming from the candidate into text and helped in finding if the candidate was found talking to someone else. Another library that was used is the SMTP.js library that helped in sending the email from the system to the proctor about the status of the candidate and inform the proctor if the cadidate was found cheating.

### UI Components

The User Interface consists of the webpages. The user can use the solution on various devices by just visiting the deployed webpage and logging into the website. Then the user can provide the accesss to the Microphone and Webcam which will be used in order to proctor the candidate. The proposed solution is a web based solution that makes it platform as well as device independent.

## Installation

1. In order to run the project locally on the device one can either just visit the webpage or clone the github repository to their local device.

2. The project can be unzipped and opened in any Text Editor preferably VSCode.

3. The User can click on GO Live{live server extension by Ritwick Dey} button in the VSCode to start this website.

4. The user can login to the system and use various services on their local device.
